# Hiring process at Didomi

For engineering positions at Didomi, our hiring process is made of 4 steps:

- Introductory call with a Tech Lead or the CTO
- A code challenge to build a simple project (API, SPA, etc.). This is used as the basis of discussion for the next step. You can find all our challenges on this repository. We also accept suitable open-source or personal projects in place of the challenge.
- A Ëœ1h code review and architecture session with 3-4 Didomi engineers
- A set of 1:1 30-minute calls with the CTO, engineers, and (occasionally) a product manager

The whole process should not take more than 2 weeks start to end. After the challenge has been sent by the candidate, scheduling and interviewing should be done within 1 week.
